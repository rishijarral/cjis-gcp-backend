# Ignore all files by default
*

# --- Allow files and directories essential for the Docker build ---
!Dockerfile
!docker-compose.yml # Though docker-compose.yml isn't strictly needed by the daemon, it's common to not ignore it
!requirements.txt
!entrypoint.sh

# Allow application code and necessary data for the build stage (if any)
!api/
# !data/output_jsonl/ # Only if this is truly needed IN THE IMAGE during build. Usually data is mounted.

# --- Allow other scripts if they are part of the build context (e.g., copied into image) ---
# !parsing_script.py # Only if copied into the image via Dockerfile
# !generate_project_overview.sh
# !run_local.sh
# !run_main.sh

# --- Files that should explicitly NOT be in the build context or image ---
# .env # Secrets/config should be injected, not copied. If you DO need it, uncomment one !.env above.

# --- Common Python and OS cruft ---
